# MealPlaner
Android Meal Planer App

I started this project as a practice. The main goal was to generate a weekly meal plan 
so that I can put it on the fridge -> pdf-Export.  
The app should also help me and my family to choose from our day-to-day dishes.

I will add more features in the future like:

- generate shopping list
- share the mealplan from user to user
- share receipes from user to user
- and more

For now this is the mvp. If you have any questions or suggestions please write me.
