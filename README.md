# MealPlaner
Android Meal Planer App

I started this project as a practice. The main goal was to generate a weekly meal plan 
so that I can put it on the fridge -> pdf-Export.  
The app should also help me and my family to choose from our day-to-day dishes.
I know there are alot of apps in the play store how do the same.

I will add more features in the future like:
- generate shopping list
- share the mealplan from user to user
- share receipes from user to user
...

For now this is my mvp.
